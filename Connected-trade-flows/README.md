#### Abstract
This paper proposes a new econometric specification for gravity equations grounded in the countries' network-leveraging features. Building on spatial autoregressive specifications, we endogenize trade costs by characterizing them as a function of a network of countries' proximities. Under the resulting model specification, the network-leveraging feature induces interdependence among trade flows and pair-specific heterogeneity. The conventional iceberg cost is a special case when countries do not leverage their network connections. For estimation, we use the PPML estimator and develop a robust method that accommodates heteroskedasticity and unknown error correlations for inference. Moreover, we develop a novel algorithm for a linear transformation from a large-dimensional network multiplier matrix, enabling much faster computation. In the empirical application, we find evidence of endogenous trade costs. Our model significantly improved fit relative to the conventional gravity equation, with gains of up to 30\%. In detail, it implies the existence of pair-specific heterogeneities not captured by the existing models. By counterfactual analysis, we show that a bilateral increase in trade costs leads to substantial reallocations of import shares across a wide range of third countries, once network interactions are accounted for.
